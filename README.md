Hii, I'm Sagar Jha.

I am a **Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)**, focusing on **Distributed Systems, Machine Learning Systems, and Natural Language Processing**. My work centers on **building scalable, production-grade ML systems**, where algorithmic performance, system efficiency, and real-world constraints matter equally.

I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering**, an **AMIE in Electronics & Communication Engineering** (with a focus on **Mechatronics, Robotics, and Automation**), and a **Gold Medal in Advanced Diploma in Mechatronics & Industrial Automation (CSIO-ISTC)**. This multidisciplinary training grounds my work across **systems, ML, and physical-world deployment**.

### Professional Experience

**Software Engineer — JPMorgan Chase & Co.**
I worked on **data-intensive distributed systems** for trade analytics, designing pipelines that processed large volumes of financial data with strong correctness and latency requirements. I also built **NLP-driven chatbots** used internally, and contributed to **AWS-based cloud migrations**, modernizing legacy on-prem systems into scalable, fault-tolerant architectures. This role shaped my interest in **ML deployment, reliability, and systems-level performance**.

**Robotics Engineer — FANUC (Industrial Automation)**
Prior to software and ML, I spent ~4 years designing and deploying **industrial robotic systems** across large-scale manufacturing environments. I worked on **real-time control, automation workflows, and system integration**, where failures had physical consequences. This experience deeply informs how I think about **correctness, latency, and robustness**, which now translates directly into my work on **distributed systems and ML infrastructure**.

### Research & Projects

I have worked on **Machine Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision projects**, and authored **research papers in applied deep learning**. My current focus is on **NLP systems**—not just model accuracy, but **efficient inference, data pipelines, and end-to-end system behavior**. I am particularly interested in problems that sit at the boundary of **ML and systems**, such as scalable training, model serving, and resource-aware inference.

### Research Interests

* Distributed Systems & ML Systems
* Natural Language Processing
* Computer Vision
* Robotics & Embodied AI

### Long-Term Vision

My long-term goal is to build **intelligent systems with visual and conversational perception**, capable of understanding their environment and interacting with humans in meaningful, reliable ways—bridging **machine learning, systems engineering, and real-world deployment**.

📌 Open to opportunities in **Distributed Systems, Machine Learning, NLP, Deep Learning**, and **Python / KDB+/Q** roles.

**Long-term goal:** to build machines with **visual and conversational perception**, enabling them to understand, reason about, and respond intelligently to their environments.
