Hii, I'm Sagar Jha.

Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer at JPMorgan Chase & Co. on data analytics for trades and developing Chatbots. Also working on AWS for maintaining and migrating existing systems from on-premises to the cloud. I completed my bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering. 

Well, I am interested and have recently been working on Machine Learning roles to extract meaningful insights or executable information from the data. I have experience in Computer Vision and am currently focusing much of my attention on NLP to derive practical solutions that include the gains from both domains. I have worked on ML/AI projects and have authored research papers on applied deep learning.

I enjoy working on artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision and machine learning; and my research interests include related fields such as robotics, natural language processing, human-computer interaction, and computational neuroscience. My long-term goal is to equip machines with visual and conversational perception abilities, which enable them to understand and respond to their surroundings.

Please reach out to me if you have any opportunities in the field of Deep Learning or in Python and KDB+/Q. 

Prior role: I am an ex-FANUC Robotics Engineer with a demonstrated history of working in the Industrial Automation industry for about four years. I have experience implementing projects across India involving various applications. I have a strong academic background with a GOLD Medal in Advanced Diploma in Mechatronics and Industrial Automation from CSIO-ISTC and an AMIE in ECE focused on Electronics, Mechatronics, Robotics, and Automation Engineering.
