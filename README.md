Hii, I'm Sagar Jha.

👋 Hi, I’m Sagar

I’m a **Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)**, working at the intersection of **Distributed Systems, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing**. My interests lie in building **scalable ML systems** that move beyond models and operate reliably under real-world constraints.

Previously, I worked as a **Software Engineer at JPMorgan Chase & Co.**, where I built **software for trading systems**, developed **NLP based chatbots**, and contributed to **cloud migrations on AWS**. This experience shaped my interest in **production ML**, system reliability, and large-scale data processing.

I actively work on **Machine Learning and AI projects**, with a focus on **NLP and Computer Vision**, and have authored **research papers in applied deep learning**. I’m particularly interested in problems where **ML, systems, and data engineering intersect**, such as efficient inference, model deployment, and ML infrastructure.

Before transitioning fully into software and ML, I spent ~4 years as a **FANUC Robotics Engineer** in the **Industrial Automation** domain, implementing robotics and automation projects at scale. This background gives me a strong foundation in **robotics, mechatronics, and hardware–software co-design**.

**Research interests:** NLP, Computer Vision, Robotics, Human–Computer Interaction, and Computational Neuroscience.

**Long-term goal:** to build machines with **visual and conversational perception**, enabling them to understand, reason about, and respond intelligently to their environments.
